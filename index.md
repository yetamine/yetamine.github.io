# About us

Yetamine is a brand focused on supporting Java application developers. We focus mostly on developing small, but useful general libraries. Check [our projects on GitHub][Yetamine@GitHub] and feel free to use them. All released artifacts are available at [Maven Central][Yetamine@Maven] at your service.

**We welcome your feedback, ideas and even participation!**


# Our standards

We committed ourselves to crafting clean code:

1. Strive for **perfection**.
2. Always try to **improve**.
3. Provide complete and up-to-date **documentation**.
4. Respect [**semantic versioning**](https://semver.org/).
5. Keep **minimal dependencies** on other projects.

Keeping minimal dependencies means that we favour writing pure code that does not require a particular framework support and that should be usable in most environments, although we admit that our preference of robustness and safety (implying often immutability) may not play well with frameworks requiring not-so-good practices. However, due to our focus on semantic versioning we support OSGi by default if possible and sensible.

Semantic versioning affects our workflow as well. Check [Yetamine Flow](flow.html) if you are interested.
